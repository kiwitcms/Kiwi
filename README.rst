Python and Django. It features Bugzilla and JIRA integration, fast test plan 
and runs search, powerful access control for each plan, run and case, and XML-RPC APIs.


Brief history
-------------

* Feb 2009 - Project created by Red Hat, Inc. as a replacement for Testopia
  under the name Nitrate
* Nov 2014 - Source code published on GitHub without previous history
* Aug 2016 - Mr. Senko starts contributing to Nitrate
* May 2017 - Upstream appears to be totally unresponsive, Mr. Senko
  `creates a fork <http://mrsenko.com/blog/mr-senko/2017/05/26/nitrate-is-now-kiwitestpad/>`_
  and continues rapid development separately
* Aug 2017 - The fork has support for the latest Django version
* Sep 2017 - Project name changed to **Kiwi TCMS** and migrated to Python 3,
  started migrating to modern UI using Patternfly
* Oct 2017 - Kiwi TCMS has an official website at http://kiwitcms.org and
  will be developed as a community project sponsored by Mr. Senko.
* Nov 2017 - merge the python-nitrate API client sources and modify them
  to work with the current code base.


Security issues
---------------

* The reported
  `XSS in SimpleMDE <https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEMDE-72570>`_ has been
  resolved by overriding its configuration and by using
  `bleach <https://github.com/mozilla/bleach>`_ to sanitize the rendered text
  before showing it inside our templates. See
  ``tcms/static/js/simplemde_security_override.js`` and
  ``tcms/core/templatetags/extra_filters.py``.
* The reported
  `XSS in Bootstrap <https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20160627>`_ is fixed in
  version 3.4 which is expected around
  `Dec 10th 2018 <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25679#issuecomment-442502490>`_
