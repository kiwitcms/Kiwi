Python API for the Kiwi TCMS test case management system
========================================================

This package consists of a high-level Python
module (provides natural object interface), a low-level driver
(allows to directly access Kiwi's xmlrpc API) and a command
line interpreter (useful for fast debugging and experimenting).


FEATURES
--------

Among the most essential features are:

    * Natural and concise Python interface
    * Custom level of caching & logging
    * Automated status coloring
    * Integrated test suite
    * Utility functions

The main motivation was to hide unnecessary implementation details
wherever possible so that using the API is as concise as possible.

Scripts importing ``tcms_api`` can make use of several useful
helper functions including ``info()`` for logging to stderr, ``listed()``
which converts list into nice human readable form, ``color()`` for
coloring and of course ``log.{debug,info,warn,error}`` for logging.


EXAMPLES
--------

Initialize or create an object::

    testcase = TestCase(1234)
    testrun = TestRun(testplan=<plan>, summary=<summary>)

Default iterators provided for all container objects::

    for case in TestRun(1234):
        if case.automated:
            case.status = Status("RUNNING")
            case.update()

Linking case to a plan is as simple as adding an item to a set::

    testplan.testcases.add(testcase)
    testplan.update()

However, it's still possible to use the low-level driver when a
specific features is not implemented yet or not efficient enough::

    inject = TCMS()._server.TestCase.get(46490)

For a quick start you can get some inspiration in the ``script_examples``
directory. The 'matrix.py' script demonstrates how to easily
display a matrix view of the test run results for a specific test
plan. The 'create.py' script gives a broader overview covering
object creation, attribute setting, adjusting logs and caching.

    tcms_api.config ....... Configuration, logging, coloring, caching
    tcms_api.containers ... Container classes implementation
    tcms_api.immutable .... Immutable TCMS objects
    tcms_api.mutable ...... Mutable TCMS objects

INSTALLATION
------------

    pip install tcms-api


CONFIGURATION
-------------

To be able to contact the Kiwi TCMS server a minimal user config
file ``~/.tcms.conf`` has to be provided in the user home directory::

    [tcms]
    url = https://kiwi.server/xml-rpc/
    username = myusername
    password = mypassword
