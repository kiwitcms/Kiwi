Administration guide
====================

The **ADMIN** menu allows administrators to manage:

-  Group and user permissions
-  Bug tracking systems
-  and more ...

Kiwi TCMS admin interface is automatically generated by Django and allows the
user to add, edit and delete records in the database.

|The Administration screen|


.. _configure-bug-trackers:

Configure external bug trackers
-------------------------------

One of the first steps when working with Kiwi TCMS is to configure bug
tracking systems. This can be done via the interface located at
``ADMIN -> Everything else -> Test cases -> Bug trackers``.
Each bug tracker is given a name, URL, API credentials and integration type.
The extent of integration with 3rd party bug tracking systems is documented
in :mod:`tcms.issuetracker`.

.. important::

    Details on what each field means can be found at
    :class:`tcms.testcases.models.BugSystem`. Integration details for supported
    bug trackers can be found at :mod:`tcms.issuetracker.types`! Please read
    these sections carefully before configuring integration with external bug tracking
    systems!

.. important::

    Kiwi TCMS comes with its own internal bug tracker. This is designed as
    a light-weight solution for small teams. In case you are already using an
    external defect tracking system like Bugzilla you may disable the internal
    one by defining ``KIWI_DISABLE_BUGTRACKER=yes`` in your environment
    variables!

    .. versionadded:: 8.4

Managing permissions
--------------------

The Auth administration section covers Groups and Users.

|The Auth screen|

Groups
~~~~~~

Kiwi TCMS uses groups to manage access to parts of the system. Groups
have two fields: name and permissions. By default there are two groups
created

* Administrator - has all available permissions;
* Tester - has ``add``, ``change`` and ``delete`` permissions from the
  ``attachments``, ``bugs``, ``django_comments``, ``management``,
  ``linkreference``, ``testcases``, ``testplans`` and ``testruns``
  applications.


Adding a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A group requires a name and a set of permissions.

Procedure: Adding a group
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a group:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.

   |The Admin menu 1|

#. Click **Groups**, then click **Add Group**.

   |The Add group link|

#. In the add group screen, perform the following actions:

   -  Enter the **Name** for the group.
   -  From **Available permissions**, select the Group's permissions.

#. Click **Add**.

   |The Add Group button|

   The **Chosen permissions** list is updated.
#. Click **Save**.

Editing a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The group name can be changed. Permissions can be added or removed.

Procedure: Editing a group
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To edit a group:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Groups**.
#. From the Group list, click the group to edit.
#. Select the permission required. Click **Add** or **Remove** as
   required.
#. Click **Save**.

Users
~~~~~

Assigning administrator rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with administrator rights can access the **ADMIN** menu.

Procedure: Assigning administrator rights
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To assign administrator rights:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Users**.
#. In the **Search Bar**, enter the username, and then click **Search**.
#. Click the **Username**.
#. In the **Permissions** screen, select **Staff status**.

   |The Staff Status check box|

#. Click **Save**. The **Staff Status** icon changes to a green tick.

.. note::

  If the user requires full permissions, select **Superuser status**.

Assigning permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User permissions can be granted or revoked for individual components of
Kiwi TCMS. All permissions are prefixed with the ``add_``, ``change_`` and
``delete_`` prefixes signifying the operation which is controlled by this
permission. Then the codename contains the name of the model for which this
permission applies. For example, the ability to add attachments to a Test Case
is controlled via the ``add_testcaseattachment`` permission.

Procedure: Assigning permissions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To assign permissions:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Users**.
#. In the **Search Bar**, enter the username, and then click **Search**.
#. Click the **Username**.
#. In the **User permission** screen:

   -  To add permissions, select the permissions to be granted, and then
      click **Add**.
   -  To remove permissions, select the permissions to be revoked, and
      then click **Remove**.

#. Click **Save**.

Adding a user to a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Group permissions in Kiwi TCMS work the same as they do in Linux. The
system checks a user's personal permissions, then group permissions.

Procedure: Adding a user to a group
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a user to a group:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Users**.
#. In the **Search Bar**, enter the username, and then click **Search**.
#. Click the **Username**.
#. From **Groups** select the user to add.
#. Click **Save**.

Updating personal information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kiwi TCMS can store email, first and last name details of a user.
To update personal information:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Users**.
#. In the **Search Bar**, enter the username, and then click **Search**.
#. Click the **Username**.
#. From **Personal Information** edit:

   -  First Name
   -  Last Name
   -  Email Address

#. Click **Save**.

Deleting a user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. danger::

    Users can be deleted from Kiwi TCMS however this will remove all database
    records connected to this user. A user that is no longer required
    must be disabled instead!

To disable a user:

#. From the **ADMIN** menu, click **Users and groups**.
#. Click **Users**.
#. In the **Search Bar**, enter the username, and then click **Search**.
#. Click the **Username**.
#. Untick the **Active** checkbox.

   |The Active checkbox|

#. Click **Save**.


.. _explanation-of-entities:

Explanation of editable entities
--------------------------------

Some DB entities are editable via the Admin interface. Their meaning is
explained below.


Products
~~~~~~~~

All testing is based around products made by the organization.


Product Classifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Classification is a title used to group products of a similar nature.
For example: Mobile apps, Desktop apps, etc.


Builds and Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entity Build describes a product build used for testing. Depending on
your versioning scheme and release workflow this entity may be used or not!

For example there could be an upcoming product version tagged "3.1" with
several daily builds (aka smaller versions) until you are
satisfied with the quality of the product before "3.1" released.

On the other hand if you release often in small increments product Version
is likely the only numbering scheme that you will use.
Each product in Kiwi TCMS needs a version. Many products will have
multiple versions. For example, Firefox 3.0.14, 3.5.3.

Kiwi TCMS allows both
Build and Version to be specified when testing. If you don't use builds we
advise you either to leave as "undefined" or use the same value as for the
version being tested.

Tags
~~~~

Kiwi TCMS uses tags to assign additional meta-data during testing. Tags can
be assigned to TestPlan, TestCase and TestRun objects. The following
permissions are taken into account:

- ``management.add_tag`` - if missing users will not be able to auto-create
  tags and are instead forced to use pre-existing ones. Inside the web UI
  autocomplete widgets help figure out what is available. This is useful in
  organizations where freely creating tags is not allowed! Also controls
  adding new objects via admin panel.
  ``management.delete_tag`` - controls deleting tags from the database via
  admin panel
- ``test{case|run|plan}.{add|delete}_test{case|run|plan}tag`` - control if
  user can assign or remove tags to test case, test run or test plan objects
  respectively.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

A product is broken down into components. For example, two components of
Kiwi TCMS are the web interface and the RPC API service. Components may be used
to classify test cases that are related to particular area under test.


Priorities
~~~~~~~~~~

Test cases can be assigned a priority. The priority designation may be used
to organize your testing workflow and does not have special meaning inside
Kiwi TCMS.


Test Plan types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Test Plan type is used to describe the test being performed. For
example, acceptance or smoke testing, functional testing, etc.


Test Case categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test case category may be used to further describe the type of test being
performed or convey additional information about the test case. Similar
information may also be conveyed with tags, properties or in other way
so it is up to you to decide how you want to organize your testing workflow!


Test Execution statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 8.0

As shown in :ref:`data_organization_kiwitcms` TestExecution objects record
the status for each TestCase tied to a particular TestRun.
Kiwi TCMS installs several pre-configured statuses by default. Starting with
v8.0 you can fully customize them!

For this purpose the following fields are available:

- **Name** - human readable status name

  .. note::

      For statuses shipped with Kiwi TCMS the names may appear translated
      into local language! If you change these default names they will
      appear untranslated!

      Translation of non-default names is currently not straight forward,
      see https://github.com/ecometrica/django-vinaigrette/issues/45.

- **Color** - a color to be used for icons, charts, etc.

  .. note::

      For a consistent user experience we recommend using colors of the same family
      (or even the same color) for the various weight categories - green
      for *Positive*, black/gray for *Neutral* and red for *Negative*!

- **Icon** - a CSS class to be used for visual display. The accepted
  value is any valid class name from
  `Font Awesome v4.7 <https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/>`_ or
  `Patternfly v3.0 <https://www.patternfly.org/v3/styles/icons/index.html>`_

  .. note::

      Icons must be specified with their full CSS class name. For example
      ``PASSED`` is ``fa fa-check-circle-o``!

- **Weight** - integer representation of this status

  .. note::

      Kiwi TCMS recognizes only 3 weight categories:

      - *Positive* - ``PASSED`` and ``WAIVED`` - test completed and was
        successfull or was skipped/ignored on purpose
      - *Neutral* - ``IDLE``, ``PAUSED`` and ``RUNNING`` - test has
        not been executed yet and the result is unknown
      - *Negative* - ``BLOCKED``, ``ERROR`` and ``FAILED`` - test completed
        unsuccessfully or was not able to complete due to external factors

      Kiwi TCMS does not make any other distinction based on weight except
      when sorting statuses for display (e.g. a row of buttons)! It is up to you
      to define what each individual status means.

  .. warning::

      Make sure to always have at least 1 positive, 1 negative and 1 nautral
      status, e.g. ``PASSED``, ``IDLE``, ``FAILED``. If you delete all statuses
      within a certain weight group Kiwi TCMS will crash!
