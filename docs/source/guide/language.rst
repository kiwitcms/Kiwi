Language preferences
====================

Kiwi TCMS will use the information provided by your browser via the
**Accept-Language** header in order to display a localized interface!
If translation for your local language isn't available it will default
to English!

.. important::

    There is no language selection button in Kiwi TCMS! You can configure
    the preferred language for displaying web pages directly in your browser!
