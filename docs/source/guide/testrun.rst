Creating a Test Run
-------------------

Test runs are created for a specific Test Plan. Only Test Cases which are
confirmed (aka ready for execution) can be added to the Test Run. A Test Run
can be assigned to any user in Kiwi TCMS. To create a Test Run:

#. Open a Test Plan
#. Select test cases for execution
#. From the bulk-update menu click **New TestRun**

   |The New Run button|

#. In the **New TestRun** page, perform the following actions:

   -  Edit the **Summary**.
   -  Select **Build**.
   -  Select **Manager**.
   -  Select **Default Tester**.
   -  Enter any **Notes**.

   |The Create New Test Run screen|

#. Confirmed Test Cases will be shown at the bottom of the above page.
#. Click **Save** button.

.. note::

    Kiwi TCMS notifies the default tester by email that they have been assigned a
    new Test Run!

Add Test Cases to an existing Test Run
--------------------------------------

To add a Test Case to an existing Test Run:

#. Open the Test Run.
#. Use the quick search widget to find and add test cases.

   |The Add cases to run button|

#. Confirmed test cases will be added to the test run.
#. Alternatively you can use the advanced search widget which allows more
   flexible search for test cases across the entire database.

.. note::

    As of version 8.9 Kiwi TCMS allows test runs to contain test cases
    which are not part of the parent test plan. They are indicated with
    a thunderbolt icon in front of their name.
